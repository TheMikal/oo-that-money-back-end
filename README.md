# Oo That Money Back-End

This app is an e-commerce back-end with no front-end attached to it. The app is to keep track of products and supplies within a company.
## Uses/Examples

To use the app you can either attach it to a front end service or use a program like insomnia to affect the database on your local host.

To use the app on your local host, clone the repo code and use ```npm start``` to launch the server. Then use Insomnia to navigate to the right address and fill out the data!
